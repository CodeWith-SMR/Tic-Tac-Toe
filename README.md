# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Design: CodeWithSMR

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to mark X's and O's on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- Two-player functionality (X and O)
- Interactive grid with dynamic feedback
- Game reset option
- Winner detection logic

## How to Play

1. The first player selects X, and the second player automatically takes O.
2. Players take turns clicking on the grid cells to place their mark.
3. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.
5. The game can be reset anytime using the reset button.
